# Type 1 Compute Documentation

Welcome to the Type 1 Compute documentation site.

## Projects

### SpikeYoloV8-Tracker

**Event-based Object Detection & Tracking with Spiking Neural Networks**

A complete end-to-end pipeline for real-time object detection and tracking using event camera data. The architecture is adapted from the BICLab SpikeYOLO ECCV 2024 implementation.

**Key Features:**
- BICLab ECCV 2024 Implementation with I-LIF spiking neurons
- Configurable-class detection
- Object tracking through time using ByteTracker
- Event processing for SNN processing
- Highly configurable training and testing pipeline
